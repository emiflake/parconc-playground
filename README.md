# Parallel & Concurrent playground
A playground for my exploration with the book _Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell_ by Simon Marlow. There is no real rhyme or reason for any of the structure or choices of direction I explore, it's just for fun and profit! Some code is directly copied from Simon's examples repository [parconc-examples](https://github.com/simonmar/parconc-examples). 

## Building
My playground is built using `stack`. So to play around, you can use `stack ghci`.
